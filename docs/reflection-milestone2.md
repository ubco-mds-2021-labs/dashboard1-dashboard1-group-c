In general, our group has complete all the plots that we have proposed in the first lab with a little change. Based on TA's suggestion, we have changed our first count bar chart to the pie chart of each province and counting the models in that province. For the scatter plot of different location, our team have tried our best to add a Canada map into the background of our plot. We don't know if we can add some detail into the geo-graph, such as city, to make it more beautiful.So far, we finished all basic requirements of our plot.

Some limitation of our dashboard is that we don't include variety information since we most focus on the relationship of the location in Canada and Turbine. Another limitation is that we haven't integrate our plots nicely in the whole dashboard. We will need to do some position adjustment so that plots are aligned. In addition, we can add some clear and nice elements/icons in our dashboard to make it looks tidy and interesting.
