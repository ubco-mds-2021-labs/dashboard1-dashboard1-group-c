In general, our group has complete all the plots that we have proposed in the first lab with a little change. Based on TA's suggestion, we have changed our first count bar chart to the pie chart of each province and counting the models in that province. For the scatter plot of different location, our team have tried our best to add a Canada map into the background of our plot. We don't know if we can add some detail into the geo-graph, such as city, to make it more beautiful.So far, we finished all basic requirements of our plot.

Some limitation of our dashboard is that we don't include variety information since we most focus on the relationship of the location in Canada and Turbine. Another limitation is that we haven't integrate our plots nicely in the whole dashboard. We will need to do some position adjustment so that plots are aligned. In addition, we can add some clear and nice elements/icons in our dashboard to make it looks tidy and interesting.


### Our Implementation:

Our dashboard for wind turbines has in total of four plots including two bar graphs, one map and one line chart. The map will represent the different locations of the turbines present in different provinces. Total capacity bar graph will depict the total capacity of the wind turbines present in various provinces. Line chart is showing the total count of the wind turbines in various locations. And finally, the top right bar graph is for different models of wind turbines in various provinces.

We have interactive widgets on the side bar. One is a drop down, which will let the user select the province about which he wants to fetch the information. Another is the slider to select the particular year. This will help user to know the timeline of how wind turbines were increased in particular province.

### Changes we did:

In general, our group has complete all the plots that we have proposed a little change. Based on TA's suggestion, we have changed our pie chart to the bar chart of each province and counting the models in that province. For the map of different location, our team have tried our best to add a Canada map into the background of our plot. We have made certain modifications, for an instance, we have added color to the map. Also, we have added maximum year as the default value. In addition to this, for full Canada, the bar chart for model will display top 5 models of Canada.

### Ease in using the app:

It is quite easy to use our application. We have tried to make it as user friendly as possible. What different widgets do, a small description has been added for that as well. Overall, it is user friendly and can be accessed very easily. 

### Feedbacks:

We did got some feedbacks from the TA and from our fellow classmates as well. We have tried our level best to implement all of those. Based on TA's suggestion, we have changed our pie chart to the bar chart of each province and counting the models in that province. For the map of different location, our team have tried our best to add a Canada map into the background of our plot. We have made certain modifications, for an instance, we have added color to the map. Also, we have added maximum year as the default value. In addition to this, for full Canada, the bar chart for model will display top 5 models of Canada.

### Useful Feedback:

Changing pie chart to bar chart was quite helpful. Following that suggestion, our dashboard is more organized and eye catchy. It is more easy to understand the data properly by implementing this suggestion.
