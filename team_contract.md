## Goals
* Build a DASH app as per the sketch and meeting the project requirements.
* Learn how to create dashboards in both Python and R effectively.
* Achieve high grade.
## Meeting Norms
* Meetings will be figured out in advance based on discussing schedules.
* Regular meeting will happen during the lab time, and sometime on Monday.
* If we need irregular meeting, we can schedule that on ad-hoc basis.
* The team will meet through Zoom and in each meeting, have an updated contributions and challenges faced on specific tasks assigned.
* Generally plan to do any required collaborative work during the lab sessions or other scheduled time.

## Work Norms
* Work will be divided based on team discussions, generally trying to split equal loads, and based on interest in tasks.
* If any team member is struggling with a task, the group will help sort it out.
* Work will be reviewed using Pull Requests and discussed/resolved using comments as well as in Slack.
* Work should be done within the established deadlines and can be done as wanted by each member.
* We work in different time zones and respect this, especially when setting up recurring meetings.
* We cannot merge pull requests without other members reviewing it
* We use Slack as major communication tool.

## Decision Making
* All major project direction decisions will be discussed and decided upon as a group.
* Minor decisions (e.g. Plot type, color, label, etc) can be made, but should be mentioned during the meeting.
* Any decision conflicts will be discussed/resolved in a group setting as required.



## Final Reflection on Workload Distribution

In this section we will ask you to self-report the workload distribution to various categories of tasks.
For each of the categories, we want you to report the approximate workload distribution, split by the milestone.

Here are the tables you are expected to complete (the first one is pre-filled in so you can see what we're expecting):

### Milestone 1

|--------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Repository Setup   | -             | -             | -             | -             |
| Sketch             | -             | 100%          | -             | -             |

Brief notes/explanations (optional):
- No troubleshooting was needed for Milestone 1
- Repository setup was done automatically (nothing to do)
